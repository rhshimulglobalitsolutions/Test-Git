What is Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)?
 Azure AD is a cloud-based identity and access management service. 
This service helps your employees access external resources and internal resources.
Such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, or any cloud apps developed for your own organization etc. 
Ex: IT admins, App developers, Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, or Dynamics CRM Online subscribers.

There are three common ways to use AD-based services in Azure. 
 1.AD DS - AD DS is a central component in many organizations with an on-premises 
IT environment and provides core user account authentication and computer management features.
 2.Azure AD - Cloud-based identity and mobile device management that provides
user account and authentication services for resources such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, 
or SaaS applications. Azure AD can be sync with an on-premises AD DS and provide a single identity to users that 
works natively in the cloud.
 3.Azure AD DS â€“ Provides managed domain services with a subset of fully
compatible traditional AD DS features such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos / NTLM authentication.

Compare Active Directory to Azure Active Directory: 
 Microsoft introduced AD DS in Windows 2000 to give organizations the ability to manage multiple on-premises 
infrastructure components and systems using a single identity per user.
Azure AD takes this approach to the next level by providing organizations with an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) 
solution for all their apps across cloud and on-premises.
