Active Directory (AD): AD is a database and set of services that connect users with the network resources they 
need to get their work done.                                             The database (or directory) contains 
critical information about your environment, for example, the database might list 100 user accounts with details 
like each person’s job title, phone number and password. It will also record their permissions.
This services control much of the activity in your IT environment. They make sure each person is who they claim 
to be (authentication), usually by checking the user ID and password they enter and allow them to access only the 
data they’re allowed to use (authorization). AD is like a tool for translating company resources into files and 
placing them in hierarchical folders to make it easier to see where they are.
