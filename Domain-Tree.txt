Domain Tree (Forest): when it comes to large companies, they have subsidiaries and branch offices, and in some 
cases create separate domains. If you need the parent company's resources, it is inconvenient to create an account 
and access them again, so you can build a trust relationship between each domain and set a policy that allows 
access.  This is called a domain tree. IT is also possible to establish a trust relationship with an entirely 
different domain (domain tree).
