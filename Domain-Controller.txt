Domain Controller (DC): AD creates areasã€€called "domains" that represent relationships between resources. 
You can think of domains like large folders. Within this domain you can handle information about resources such 
as users, printers, PCs, shared data, departments and project teams. DC is a server that responds to verification 
requirements and evaluates clients in PC organizations. A domain is a continuous process of filtering clients and 
PCs collaborating into the same organization.Domain Manager keeps all information integrated and accessible. 
Domain regulator (DC) is the most powerful authority in Active Directory (AD).
