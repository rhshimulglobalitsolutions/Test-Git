Active Directory (AD): AD is a database and set of services that connect users with the network resources 
they need to get their work done.The database (or directory) contains critical information about your environment,
for example, the database might list 100 user accounts with details like each person’s job title, phone number and
password. It will also record their permissions.This services control much of the activity in your IT environment.
They make sure each person is who they claim to be (authentication), usually by checking the user ID and password
they enter and allow them to access only the data they’re allowed to use (authorization). AD is like a tool for 
translating company resources into files and placing them in hierarchical folders to make it easier to see where 
they are. 

Domain Controller (DC): AD creates areas　called "domains" that represent relationships between resources. 
You can think of domains like large folders. Within this domain you can handle information about resources such as 
users, printers, PCs, shared data, departments and project teams. DC is a server that responds to verification 
requirements and evaluates clients in PC organizations. A domain is a continuous process of filtering clients and 
PCs collaborating into the same organization.Domain Manager keeps all information integrated and accessible. 
Domain regulator (DC) is the most powerful authority in Active Directory (AD).
