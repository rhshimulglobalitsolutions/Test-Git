Migrate from On Premise AD to Azure Active Directory?

Azure AD is not designed to be the cloud version of AD. It is not a domain controller or a directory in the cloud 
that will provide the exact same capabilities with AD in a different way. That’s why there is no actual 
“migration” path from AD to Azure AD. You can synchronize your on-premises (AD or other) to Azure AD but not 
migrate your computer accounts, group policies, OU etc. 

Azure AD is an identity and access management solution for hybrid or cloud-only implementations. It can extend 
the reach of your on-premises identities to any SaaS application hosted in any cloud. It can provide secure remote 
access, identity management, cloud app discovery, Multi-Factor Authentication, protection of your identities in the 
cloud, reporting of Sign-ins from possibly infected devices, leaked credentials report, user behavioral analysis 
are a few additional things that we couldn’t even imagine with the traditional AD on-premises.
