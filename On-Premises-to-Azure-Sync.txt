Synchronization from on-premises AD DS to Azure AD using managed domain:

In a hybrid environment, objects and credentials from an on-premises AD DS domain can be synchronized to Azure AD using Azure AD Connect. Once those objects are 
successfully synchronized to Azure AD, the automatic background sync then makes those objects and credentials like, (user accounts, group memberships, credential 
hashes, UPN and on-premises security identifier (SID), NTLM, and Kerberos) are available to applications using the managed domain.

Azure AD Connect should only be installed and configured for synchronization with on-premises AD DS environments. 
Not to synchronize objects back to Azure AD. For example, if a user changes their password using Azure AD self-service password management, the password is updated 
back in the on-premises AD DS environment.

Synchronization from a multi-forest on-premises environment
Many organizations have a complex on-premises AD DS environment that includes multiple forests. Azure AD has a much simpler and flat namespace. To enable users to 
reliably access in different forests. 

The Azure AD Connect synchronization services is a main component of Azure AD Connect. This topic is also called sync engine. 
Both on-premises and Azure AD are connected to the Azure AD Connect sync engine
